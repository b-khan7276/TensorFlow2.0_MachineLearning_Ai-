## Types of Machine Learning

### There are three Types of Machine Learning

- supervised Learning
- un-supervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

### Machine Learning Algos

- linear Regression
- Classification
- Hidden Markov Model

##Tools
### Numpy:
    NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, 
    adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices,
    along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate 
    on these arrays.The ancestor of NumPy, 
### Pandas:
    Pandas is data analytics tools, it allows us to manipulate data sets.
### Matplotlib:
    Matplotlib is used for visualations for graphs and charts
