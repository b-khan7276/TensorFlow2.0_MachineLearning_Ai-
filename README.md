## Types of Machine Learning

### There are three Types of Machine Learning

- supervised Learning
- un-supervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

### Machine Learning Algos

- linear Regression
- Classification
- Hidden Markov Model

##Tools
### Numpy:
    NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, 
    adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices,
    along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate 
    on these arrays.The ancestor of NumPy, 
### Pandas:
    Pandas is data analytics tools, it allows us to manipulate data sets.
### Matplotlib:
    Matplotlib is used for visualations for graphs and charts
    
 ## Clustering:
    " Clustering is a machine leaning technique  that involes the grouping of 
    data points and tell you locations of that data points " 
      
### Basic Algorithm for K-Means.
    -Step 1: Randomly pick K points to place K centroids
    -Step 2: Assign all the data points to the centroids by distance. The closest centroid to a point is the one it is assigned to.
    -Step 3: Average all the points belonging to each centroid to find the middle of those clusters (center of mass). 
             Place the corresponding centroids into that position.
    -Step 4: Reassign every point once again to the closest centroid.
    -Step 5: Repeat steps 3-4 until no point changes which centroid it belongs to.
